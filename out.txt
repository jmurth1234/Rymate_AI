PircBotX is a Java framework for writing IRC bots quickly and easily.
It provides an event-driven architecture to handle common IRC events, flood protection, DCC support, ident support, and more. The comprehensive logfile format is suitable for use with pisg to generate channel statistics.
Methods of the PircBotX class can be called to send events to the IRC server that it connects to. For example, calling the sendMessage method will send a message to a channel or user on the IRC server. Multiple servers can be supported using multiple instances of PircBotX.
To perform an action when the PircBotX receives a normal message from the IRC server, you would listen for the MessageEvent in your listener (see ListenerAdapter). Many other events are dispatched as well for other incoming lines
Yes. this bot is VERY AI..... NOT.
I'm gonna leave my bot in here for a bit
Its an AI bot based off http://www.jibble.org/jmegahal/
A rather bad one

Apparently my lines are too short. I'd better fix that! :D
lol
duckman wasn't very popular, getting kicked 2 times!
For example, like this:
agrif is either insane or just a fair op, kicking a total of 2 people! 
Oh dear
That isn't looking good
Oh phew. I thought for a second there it was becoming stupid! :D
The Minecraft Overviewer is a command-line tool for rendering high-resolution maps of Minecraft worlds. It generates a set of static html and image files and uses the Google Maps API to display a nice interactive map.
The Overviewer has been in active development for over a year and has many features, including day and night lighting, cave rendering, mineral overlays, and many plugins for even more features! It is written mostly in Python with critical sections in C as an extension module.
Renders high resolution images of your world, let’s you “deep zoom” and see details!
Gloriously awesome smooth lighting is here! (rendermode name is smooth_lighting)
Customizable textures! Pulls textures straight from your installed texture pack!
Choose from four rendering angles.
Generates a Google Maps powered map!
Runs on Linux, Windows, and Mac platforms!
Renders efficiently in parallel, using as many simultaneous processes as you want!
Only requires: Python, Numpy, and PIL (all of which are included in the Windows download!)
Utilizes caching to speed up subsequent renderings of your world. Only parts that need re-rendering are re-rendered.
Throw the output directory up on a web server to share your Minecraft world with the internet!
Run The Overviewer from a command line or on a cron schedule for constantly updated maps! Run it for your Minecraft server world to provide your users with a detailed map!
It does not run fast. Because of the high level of detail, initial renders of a world can take some time. Expect minutes for medium worlds, hours for large to huge worlds. Subsequent renders are much faster due to the caching.
Also note that speed is improving all the time. We continually make efficiency improvements to The Overviewer. Besides, for the level of detail provided, our users consider it worth the time!
The Overviewer is not targeted at end users. We mainly see Overviewer fitting in best with server operators, rendering their server’s map for all users to view.
You are welcome to use The Overviewer for your single player worlds, and it will work just fine. However, since the only interface is currently command line based, you will need to know a bit about the command line in order to operate The Overviewer.
I filled the "brain" of the bot with stuff from the overviewer wiki
meh
Lolz
i would call it dumb-bot
derchris, correct! it uses a shit ai XD
oops
I didn't realize how annoying it would be to try to access my old user files from vista
who the hell is kais58
He needs better internet

heh
Well, I'm off afk
RamsesA: oh yes, it is annyoing
I've made a shortcut on my desktop though
I hope I'm doing the right thing
I've manually changed ownership via the security tab
oh yay it worked
of?
Ooh, I see what you mean
my old C:\Users\<account name>\ folder
which had everything important in it
couldn't access it
I thought you meant "using the user interface to get there is annoying"
While this is not true for the start menu, the file->open dialog has no good way of doing so
well, I tried getting there via the explorer
and it just started this progress bar
that never ended
ever
let it go for an hour
lol
classic windows.
That actually made sense \o/
That sentence didn't make sense
what is going on in here
rymate has taken over the channel
lol
Hear his evil laughter!

timoto: timoto see here http://docs.overviewer.org/en/latest/config/#a-more-complicated-example
timoto: and ignore box-bot its just a package tracing thingy
ok
how can i install that?
timoto: you havent to install anything for multi worlds in overviewer just write a configuration file.
where must i put the conig file?
timoto: there where you let the --settings= parameter point to.
thanks
timoto: just read that whole page it explains everything you need to know if anything is unclear just ask :)
where can i found the minecraft.jar on my server
i have used the command from the doc
to download it
timoto: its that one you execute to start it.
?
timoto: you execute java -jar /path/to/minecraft.jar right?
wget -N http://s3.amazonaws.com/MinecraftDownload/minecraft.jar -P ~/.minecraft/bin/
timoto: yes that one :)
in the root folder
anyone use gimp?
how must i name the conig from the overviewer?
no
timoto: you can name it as you want (thats what --settings parameter is for.
for exampel conif.txt?
timoto: would probably work i think but its a python file so why not name it conif.py
by my texture pack can i put in the minecraft.jar?
timoto: you could set your texture pack directly to get used by overviewer.
by texturepath = "/root/.minecraft/bin/minecraft.jar" will his work?
I think so
Also, please don't run overviewer as root
thanks
CounterPillow: why not?
why not with root?
It's generally considered bad practice to run programs with more priveliges than they need. A bug or mistake can cause a lot more damage if it's running as root
where can i download the standert minecraft texture in zip format?
timoto: nowhere you have to extract it from minecraft.jar 
what the terain.png?
just put client minecraft.jar in ./minecraft/bin/
you dont need to extract it to make overviewer work
thanks
and dont set texturepath in the config
worlds["world"] = "/home/minecarft/backups/world/" worlds["skylands"] = "/home/minecraft/backups/skylands/"  renders["worldday"] = {     "world": "world",     "title": "world Daytime",     "rendermode": smooth_lighting,     "dimension": "overworld", }   renders["skylands"] = {     "world": "skylands",     "title": "skylands",     "rendermode": smooth_lighting,     "dimension": "overworld", }  outputdir = "/var/www/map/" texturepath
then it will use the .jar automatically
but what i need to put theretexturepath = "/home/my_texture_pack.zip"
so you want to use another tecture pack?
here*
and not the default?
i want to use the default
if you have the minecraft.jar in ~/.minecraft/bin/ then you dont need to set tecturepath
just leave it out
overviewer will try to use ~/.minecraft/bin/minecraft.jar if you do not set texturepath
O_o
Your bot stinks, rymate1234
ikr
That works
?getMessage
I've been pumping information into it from a minecraft map renderer wiki and the irc channel for that map render tool
:P
hi Rymate-Bot
?converse this is how you use it
Its..... not that good
oops.
Typo
XD
?gtfo
!converse This is a test
Chill wtf
that
is a long ass message
!converse This is a test
Im confused by how you do that
i might add custom commandsa
so you'll be able to do !cmdadd cmdname cmdcontent
oops
accidently the irc scrollback
AmbushReality, its a bot I programmed in java
Oh.
does it learn based on channel messages?
ye
I also shoved some stuff in from a wiki
!getMessage
That bot is stupidd :P
That is correct
:P
Still, better than i could do
also its "brain" is only 176 lines long
I tried learning java but it wouldnt do the javac stuff
I might also add some custom commands system
so you'll be able to do !cmdadd cmdname what the command says here
!converse hai
:(
!comverse this bot is sucky and it knows it
!converse this bot is sucky and it knows it
O-o
Talks shit
ikr
I did it for the lulz
I cant do that though xD
The brain is now 190 lines long! :P
One sec while i kill myself.
it needs its own hostname
Whats the point.
rymates.favourite.foxboy.org
O.O
Dazzozo, It's not gonna be 24/7
its hosted on my freaking laptop
woo
it doesn't add commands into its brain now
XD
yo
type "!gtfo" for meh
lol that works
XD
Why meee
stop people quitting the bot if they're not me
Impressive
make it say random messages at random intervals
lol
based on a recently said phrase
How do i get one? Is there a guide for it? :P
Dazzozo, maybe ;)
.
Yes
:(
uh
uh
..
da fuk
Your bot is slow.
ah
whaaat?
hi Rymate-Bot 
wtf
it dont work
ye
it quite bad
XD
what's that
i haven;t a clue
it hates url's
XD
-_-
whhhhhattttt
uh
ok
ok, that's messed up
Its never done that before
It collects its messages from irc channe;s
XD
wow
lul
so...
HI rymate1234 
lol
would you like me to help with the code?
nahhhh :P
LET ME HELP!
LUL
something tells me Rymate-Bot isn't gonna pass any turing tests
wut
wtf did that come from
do you know any WORKING AI bots?
no
There was a java lib that allowed you to hook into cleverbot
but that seems to have disappeared
otherwise i would've used that
XD
theres an online tutorial you should use
Ill find it in a min
wathicng direwolf20
lol ok
might be better than using a shitty lib
it uses jmegahal
yes
I know
I code the damn thing XD
thats what the tutorial uses
ohhhh lol
wait, there's a better way of using jmegahal? XD
probs
you need to tell the bot to run on about 30 channels
to get 50000 lines of chat in its database
the more it learns, the more it thnks
ye probably
I could probably just find some logs form irc channels
that too
does it count how many things it has learned?
nope
however notepad++ shows line numbers
:P
281 lines
you should make it so that there is a command to tell info like: lines learned, questions asked, most read channels
I'm lazy though :P
then put it on github and ill work on it
fiiine
do you know how to use git?
ye
Fuck this, im turning emo:-|
github fo windows is extracting git -_-
ARE YOU REALLY USING GITHUB FOR WINDOWS!
use plain git
unless youre a n00b
then use github for windows
hunterboerner, I'm not a noob, just lazy
:P
lul
